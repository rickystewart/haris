This folder is called "doc", and indeed, it contains something close to 
"documentation". In reality, these are just the notes I keep to assist in the
planning of the development of the protocol. They may not be entirely 
comprehensible to you, as an outsider. Eventually, I will flesh out these
documents into something more user-friendly. (In any case, it is not a good 
idea to document something before it's been fully completed, and so the 
current documentation does not strive to be complete or current. As always,
the source code trumps whatever the documentation might say.)
